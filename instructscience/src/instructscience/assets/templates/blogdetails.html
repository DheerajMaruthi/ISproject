                     <p>With self-quarantining taking a toll on individuals and businesses around the world, many are
                        eagerly waiting for life to get back to as normal as things were before the virus started. The
                        outbreak of COVID-19 has proven things that were once considered impossible are now being
                        practiced excessively but with some challenges and caveats. With several countries gradually
                        easing their isolation restrictions, the exercise of working from home is being shifted back to
                        working from conventional offices with additional precautionary measures. This involves the
                        transformation of traditional workplaces into an environment that is safe, hygienic, and caters
                        to mental health needs. In order to make your workplace more safe and healthy, it is important
                        to adhere to the guidelines essayed by organizations such as national Center for Disease Control
                        (CDC), The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE),
                        and Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating & Air (ISHRAE) to control transmission of airborne
                        particles and ensure a safe, healthy workplace. Some precautionary measures that can help ensure
                        optimal workplace safety and employee well-being as you open the doors to your offices include,
                        but aren’t limited to:</p>
                     <h4>Here are five reasons why its important to increase ventilation in buildings: -</h4>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Since COVID-19 is an airborne virus, diluting the pathogens inside the building can reduce
                           the risk of its transmission. It is, therefore, recommended to ensure good airflow and
                           ventilation rates through the installation of an air quality control system.</li>
                        <li>Trapping of stale air enhances the risk of virus indoors. Hence, high priority should be
                           given to a well-designed and effective ventilation system when it comes to building a space
                           that ensures the flow of clean and fresh air.</li>
                        <li>The risks of getting infected with COVID-19 can increase in winters as it is a season when
                           we spend most of our time indoors. Hence, in order to curtail the spread of infection, it is
                           vital to consider indoor air quality diagnostics and ventilate the building effectively.</li>
                        <li>A buildings ventilation system should be checked at regular intervals to ensure there is
                           enough airflow to dilute the virus in the inside air. One way to fulfil this is by
                           ventilating the building for long or opting for ventilation with higher airflow
                           volumes.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>
                           Poor indoor air quality is not only responsible for increasing the risk of COVID-19 but also
                           causes various respiratory problems. A <a
                              href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/news-events/news/growing-evidence-linking-indoor-air-pollution-respiratory-problems-children">joint
                              report</a> by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and the Royal
                           College of Physicians show that there is growing evidence that respiratory issues among
                           children may be outcomes of bad air quality in homes, schools, or nurseries. <a
                              href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/news-events/news/growing-evidence-linking-indoor-air-pollution-respiratory-problems-children">This
                              landmark report,</a> involving a systematic review of 221 studies, present evidences that
                           number of child health problems including asthma, conjunctivitis, wheezing, dermatitis, and
                           eczema are the result of poor indoor air quality. Within the report, the sources of indoor
                           air pollution are cited as smoking, dampness, burning of fossil fuels, the presence of dust
                           particles, chemicals from building materials, furnishings, and so on.&nbsp;
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>

                     </ul>
                     <h4>Ventilation guidelines in COVID</h4>
                     <p>In order to ensure the flow of clean air and maintain the thermal health of buildings, the
                        Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning has come up with some guidelines
                        that need to be followed at homes, offices, and hospitals. These guidelines include:&nbsp;</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Ensuring the thermal comfort of buildings by insulating the building properly</li>
                        <li>Maintaining humidity levels between 40% and 60%</li>
                        <li>Providing a high rate of airflow</li>
                        <li>Reducing the building&rsquo;s temperature through passive design upgrades</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>According to professionals and experts, terminating the use of air conditioners to prevent the
                        spread of COVID-19 infection is not a long-term solution, and improving the ventilation system
                        should be emphasized more. Most offices don&rsquo;t prefer air conditioners that allow the
                        intake of fresh air as they increase the cost of running. However, in the current circumstances,
                        clean and fresh air is one of the most important things that we need. As per experts, air
                        conditioners should be run at 24 &ndash; 27 degrees to maintain the thermal health of buildings.
                        Moreover, the air ducts of the ventilation system should also be cleaned at regular intervals to
                        make sure that clean air circulates inside the building.&nbsp;</p>
                     <p>What should the new and existing buildings do to ensure adequate ventilation?</p>
                     <p>As the COVID-19 infection spreads at a rapid pace, new buildings should invest more in passive
                        design upgrades and retrofits that can help in improving shading, insulation, and ventilation.
                        New buildings should also keep ventilation for each room in primary focus along with the
                        increased usage of technologies like H-13 certified filters, capable of processing particles up
                        to 0.003 microns. In order to improve the thermal health of buildings, the overall heat load
                        needs to be reduced. This can be done through the installation of rooftop solar panels or
                        vertical gardens. In the case of older buildings devoid of any heating or ventilation systems,
                        they should simply open windows to let in the outdoor air.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore,&nbsp; important to realize that while recirculating air has become the default
                        in our buildings, ventilating with outdoor air is vital in diluting the airborne contaminants
                        and decreasing the transmission of infection. Hence, it wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong to say that in
                        addition to everyday precautions taken by individuals, the building owners, managers, and
                        employers have a vital role to play in creating a safe environment for themselves and other
                        inhabitants.</p>
